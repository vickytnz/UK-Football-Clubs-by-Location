SVG Mapping of UK Football clubs

As a foreigner, I get confused by all of the League Clubs and the locations. Where's the line between being a Sunderland supporter and a NUFC one? Man City vs Man U? The usual maps don't help with that.
This is a work in progress trying to make it more obvious, but mapping regions against teams and their team colours.

Already I've found that I need to be more specific: some boroughs have multiple teams.

Map is based on the UK Ordinance Map.
